Using a simple list for this.
I have gotten pretty comfortable with using Python's `in` keyword. So using this to find the items I am looking for in a util function. I then check recursively in a recursive algorithm to find the correct user.

The time complexity of this algorithm is based on the sum of iterations.
Depending on the number of groups and users makes the Big O Notation as O(groups \* users).

For the space complexity, it is based on the number of function returns. With a moderately degree of certainty that is O(1).

Answer
Big O Notation: O(groups*users)
Time & Space: O(1)
```

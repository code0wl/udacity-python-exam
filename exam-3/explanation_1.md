# 1 Finding the Square Root of an Integer

Not sure if it's the best way, but I am using a simple binary search to assist me at finding the squared root of the given integer.

My approach is then through the process of elimation I check if the number given falls in between the range of 0 and the given argument.
If this is the case I then return the value.
